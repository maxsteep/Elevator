# Industrial Elevator Mock-Up Model

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive industrial elevator mock-up designed and implemented as part of a university engineering program. It demonstrates a multi-floor programmable configuration, safety-critical features, and real-time control using FPGA technology.

The elevator model is equipped with:
- A multitude of safety sensors
- Emergency stop/reset functionality
- Programmable multi-floor operation
- Analog motor control interfaced via an FPGA (using a Nios II soft-core processor)

This project showcases expertise in control systems, safety-critical design, and FPGA-based embedded development.

## Features
### Functional Highlights
- **Multi-Floor Programmable Configuration**: Supports seamless operation across multiple floors with user-defined settings.
- **Safety Sensors**: Integrated sensors for:
  - Floor alignment
  - Door position
  - Overload detection
  - Emergency stop functionality
- **Emergency Stop/Reset**: A dedicated system to halt operations safely and reset after faults.
- **Analog Motor Control**: Smooth and precise control of the elevator motor through FPGA-generated PWM signals.

### Technical Highlights
- **FPGA-Based Implementation**: Powered by a Nios II soft-core processor for real-time control and monitoring.
- **Parallel Sensor Management**: Real-time polling and interrupt-based handling for multiple sensors.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to expand for additional floors or features.

## System Architecture
The elevator mock-up system consists of the following key components:
1. **FPGA Board**: De-SoC board running a Nios II processor.
2. **Safety Sensors**: Hardware-integrated sensors for safety and operational feedback.
3. **Motor Controller**: Analog motor controlled via FPGA-generated PWM signals.
4. **User Interface**: Basic input for floor selection and emergency controls.
